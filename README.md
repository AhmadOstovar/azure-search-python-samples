# Python sample repository for Azure Search

This repository contains Python sample code used in Azure Search quickstarts, tutorials, and examples. You can use the shared (free) Azure Search service to run any sample in this repository. Samples are in individual folders in this repository.

## Python Quickstart - Azure Search

This sample is a Jupyter Python3 .ipynb file used in [Quickstart: Create and query an Azure Search index using a Jupyter Python notebook](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-python). Use this sample to learn service connections, index creation, data ingestion, and basic queries.

## Tutorial - AI-enrichments in an Azure Search indexing pipeline

This sample is also a Jupyter Python3 .ipynb file. It's used in the [Python Tutorial: Call Cognitive Services APIs in an Azure Search indexing pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-tutorial-blob-python). This sample demonstrates cognitive search functionality, adding AI enrichments from Cognitive Services to extract, detect, and analyze information from image files or large unstructured document files.
