# Python sample repository for Azure Cognitive Search

This repository contains Python sample code used in Azure Cognitive Search quickstarts, tutorials, and examples. You can use the shared (free) Azure Cognitive Search service to run any sample in this repository. Samples are in individual folders in this repository.

## Quickstart - Azure Cognitive Search

This sample is a Jupyter Python3 .ipynb file used in [Quickstart: Create and query an Azure Cognitive Search index using a Jupyter Python notebook](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-python). Use this sample to learn service connections, index creation, data ingestion, and basic queries.

## Tutorial - Add AI enrichments to an indexing pipeline

This sample is a Jupyter Python3 .ipynb file. It's used in the [Python Tutorial: Call Cognitive Services APIs in an Azure Cognitive Search indexing pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-tutorial-blob-python). This sample demonstrates cognitive search functionality, adding AI enrichments from Cognitive Services to extract, detect, and analyze information from image files or large unstructured document files.

## Tutorial - Train and deploy a custom skill with Azure Machine Learning

This sample is a Jupyter Python3 .ipynb file. It's used in the [Tutorial: Build and deploy a custom skill with Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-tutorial-aml-custom-skill). This sample provides an end-to-end walk through for training and deploying an aspect-based sentiment model to an Azure Kubernetes cluster for consumption as a custom skill in a Cognitive Search enrichment pipeline. Azure Machine Learning is used to train and deploy the model.
