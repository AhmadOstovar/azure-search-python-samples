# Azure Search Python Samples repository

This repository contains Python sample code used in Azure Search quickstarts, tutorials, and examples.

## Quickstart-Jupyter-Notebook

This sample is a .ipynb file containing a Python3 notebook used in [Quickstart: Create and query an Azure Search index using a Jupyter Python notebook](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-python). There are two placeholder values for an Azure Search service and admin API key. Replace them with valid values to create, load, and query an index on your own service.
